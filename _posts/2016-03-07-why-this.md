title: Why write about this
---

This blog is inspired in part by Gandhi's personal quest during his formative years to define his own philosophy. I'm undertakng a similar quest this year to explore what reproducible research means to me. The idea is to document it along the way. It will help me track what I've tried already, whether it worked or not, and why.

When I look at state of the art papers in my field, I can't help but think about all the opportunities we're already missing. Reproducibility matters. You don't need me to tell you that, but I can share here briefly why it matters to *me*:

It's been common experience to find a paper that does something really cool and new, and think to yourself "Hey, this is cool! Let's try this on our data." Then, we painstakingly pore over the Methods section, discuss what the author said, and what they probably _meant_, i.e. we do a lot of reading between the lines. In the end, what we do is probably different in nontrivial ways from the original author's approach. We didn't set out to do something new, we just couldn't do it the same way because there wasn't enough documentation to faithfully reproduce what the original author did. 

In the rare case when we do find enough documentation, we may find that the tools used are inaccessible due to licensing.

Reproducibility is a foundational and essential part of science. But when things aren't reproducible, it's also downright annoying.
