title: Meta analyses
---

Meta-analysis is something I'm interested in getting more acquainted with. Meta-analysis is combining data from different studies to A) increase power and B) evaluate the robustness (or reproducibility) of a finding. Today I came across this quote by [Jerry Dallal](http://www.jerrydallal.com/LHSP/meta.htm):

>If meta analysis is to have a future, perhaps it will be due to registries that allow studies to be tracked from their inception and not just on publication. This would make it impossible to publish the results of trials showing benefit while suppressing those that do not... I am less confident of whether it will be able to address the differing quality of the studies or subtle differences in the way outcomes are studied.

We see here - and he describes in more detail in the article - two problems. The first, publication bias, he says we can address by registering the study before it's started. It can also be achieved by working out in the open using a tool like GitHub. When you finish your work, whether it's published by Journal X or Y, or not at all, it's out there where the it can be identified and included in a meta-analysis.

The second problem is really two problems, differing quality of the studies and subtle differences in the way the outcomes are studied. If all the code is available, then subtle differences can be both qualitatively and quantifiably expressed. The quality can also be partially determined by comparing the procedures used to gold standards. I say partially because ins and outs of data collection are still undocumented here, leaving a lot of room for differences in quality.
